###installation

extract the materials, resources, and scripts folder inside a newly created folder (named ahud, but it can by anything) inside your custom folder. for a detailed how-to on installing a hud for tf2, check out [this guide](http://huds.tf/guides/?guide=1) on huds.tf

to use the non-box version of ahud, locate *hudplayerhealth.res* and *spectatorguihealth.res* in resources/ui, and *hudanimations_tf.txt* in scripts. delete or backup these 3 files and rename the replacement *xxx_NOBOX.xxx* versions to the original names.

###support

i have only tested this on my windows pc using a 16:9 resolution; so far it seems to work on 16:10. 4:3 resolution support possible in the future (if it doesn't work fine already). no mac or linux support. 

please post any bugs with ahud to the issues page on this repository. there is also a [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ahud) you can join to get announcement for updates to ahud.
