#ahud

it's a hud

a simplistic hud for team fortress 2 first started by [kyle](https://github.com/hikyle). ahud draws inspiration from various huds, including, but not limited to, rayshud, yahud, and omphud.


###features

* home server button (place *alias JoinHomeServer "connect x.x.x.x:xxxx"* in your autoexec.cfg)
* toggle 9v9 scoreboard (because I play highlander)
* some MvM support

###screenshots

an album of screenshots can be found [here](http://imgur.com/a/569GH)

###support

i have only tested this on my windows pc using a 16:9 resolution; so far it seems to work on 16:10. 4:3 resolution support possible in the future (if it doesn't work fine already). no mac or linux support. 

please post any bugs with ahud to the issues page on this repository. there is also a [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ahud) you can join to get announcement for updates to ahud.
