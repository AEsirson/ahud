#ahud

it's a hud

a simplistic hud for team fortress 2 first started by [kyle](https://github.com/hikyle). ahud draws inspiration from various huds, including, but not limited to, rayshud, yahud, and omphud.


###features

* home server button (place *alias JoinHomeServer "connect x.x.x.x:xxxx"* in your autoexec.cfg)
* toggle 9v9 scoreboard (because I play highlander)
* some MvM support

###screenshots

###support

since this is a personal project of mine, i don't plan on providing support or adding proposed features from the public. also note that i've only tested this on 16:9 resolutions; other aspect ratios might not work correctly with ahud.
